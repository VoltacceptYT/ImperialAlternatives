# Imperial Alternatives

**Imperial Alternatives** is a mod I created for **Skyrim SE** and **Skyrim VR**, designed to add new content to the game, including two new cloak variants: the **Imperial Soldier Cloak** and the **Imperial Legate Cloak**. These cloaks, along with other features, add additional depth and immersion to the province of Skyrim.

## Features

- **Imperial Soldier Cloak** and **Imperial Legate Cloak** added to the game.
- New immersive features to enhance the experience in Skyrim.

## Crafting Locations

- The cloaks can be crafted in **Solitude**, **Falkreath**, **Morthal**, and **Markarth**.
- After completing the **Battle for Whiterun** and siding with the **Empire** in the Civil War, youâ€™ll also be able to craft them in **Whiterun**.

## Requirements

- **Skyrim Special Edition (SE)** or **Skyrim VR**.
- **Dawnguard** DLC is required.

## Installation

1. Download the mod files.
2. Install using your preferred mod manager (e.g., Vortex, Mod Organizer 2).
3. Activate the mod in your load order.
