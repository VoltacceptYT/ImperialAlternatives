# Imperial Alternatives

**Imperial Alternatives** is a mod I created for **Skyrim SE** and **Skyrim VR**, designed to add new content to the game, including two new cloak variants: the **Imperial Soldier Cloak** and the **Imperial Legate Cloak**. These cloaks, along with other features, add additional depth and immersion to the province of Skyrim.

  - The cloaks can be crafted in **Solitude**, **Falkreath**, **Morthal**, and **Markarth**.
  - After completing the **Battle for Whiterun** and siding with the **Empire** in the Civil War, youâ€™ll also be able to craft them in **Whiterun**.
