# Imperial Alternatives

**Imperial Alternatives** is a mod I created for **Skyrim SE** and **Skyrim VR**, designed to add new content to the game, including two new cloak variants: the **Imperial Soldier Cloak** and the **Imperial Legate Cloak**. These cloaks, along with other features, add additional depth and immersion to the province of Skyrim.

## Features

- **Imperial Soldier Cloak** and **Imperial Legate Cloak** added to the game.
- New immersive features to enhance the experience in Skyrim.

## Coming Soon

**Imperial Legate Sword**  
<i>An elegantly crafted sword designed for the high-ranking officers of the Empire. The Imperial Legate Sword will bring additional flair and functionality to your Imperial roleplay. With intricate detailing and a heavier, more commanding appearance, this weapon is sure to be a prestigious addition to any Imperial soldier's arsenal.</i>



**Imperial Soldier Sword**  
<i>The Imperial Soldier Sword will be a more practical, straightforward weapon intended for the rank-and-file troops of the Empire. Simple yet effective, it will offer a solid balance between power and ease of use, perfect for the soldier who spends their days on the battlefield.</i>

## Crafting Locations

- The cloaks can be crafted in **Solitude**, **Falkreath**, **Morthal**, and **Markarth**.
- After completing the **Battle for Whiterun** and siding with the **Empire** in the Civil War, youâ€™ll also be able to craft them in **Whiterun**.

## Requirements

- **Skyrim Special Edition (SE)** or **Skyrim VR**.
- **Dawnguard** DLC is required.

## Installation

1. Download the mod files.
